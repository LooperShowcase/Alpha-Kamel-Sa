    Running for almost a decade at this point, each December we kick off the annual tradition of seeing what’s in the year’s LEGO Advent Calendars. And for 2023, there’s so much to be excited about. With 24 days of different creations on tap, we’ll be taking a day-by-day look to highlight all of the miniature creations, minifigures, and other builds in the countdown to the end of the month. This year, we’re checking out the latest LEGO Star Wars, Marvel, City, and Friends Advent Calendars for 2023.

    For the first time ever, we’re taking a look at four different LEGO Advent Calendars for 2023. So whether you’re following along at home with your own unboxing experience or just checking out the builds to get in on the festivities, be sure to head below the fold to see how the 2023 Star Wars, Marvel, City, and Friends LEGO Advent Calendars stack up. 
    
    We’ll be publishing updates each and every day up through December 24 at around 10 a.m. EST every morning. The lead image will also be a silhouette of the included characters and builds, but if you go any further you’ll see spoilers!
    
    LEGO Advent Calendars 2023 — Day 8
    Star Wars — Battle Droid
    Watch out troopers! Day 8 of the LEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar for 2023 has arrived and is giving us a Battle Droid to oppose the 212th Clone from a few days back. This Trade Federation trooper is the same Battle Droid design we’ve been getting for nearly 25 years, and is still just as perfect as it was back in 1999.
    
    Aside from noting the LEGO Battle Droid’s perfection, there’s really no notes here. I love that we get someone to oppose the Clone from Day 6, and hopefully there will be a themed build to go alongside the droid much like we saw with the command station from yesterday.
